    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These delicious chimichurri steak tacos have an Argentinian flair. Seared flank steak slices on tortillas are topped with chimichurri sauce, pickled onion, cotija, and cilantro.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound flank steak</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>4 white corn tortillas</li>
        <li>1/2 cup prepared chimichurri sauce, homemade or purchased</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pickled red onions</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded cotija cheese</li>
        <li>Cilantro, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle salt over steak to cover both sides. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to 1 day.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon oil. Fry tortillas, 1 at a time, on each side until puffy and golden brown, about 1 minute. Set aside on a plate and cover with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Sear steak in the same skillet, adding oil as needed; turn over frequently until browned, about 8 minutes per side. For medium-rare, steaks will be firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.</li>
        <li>Remove to a cutting board to rest. Once rested, slice steak against the grain.</li>
        <li>Serve in tortilla and top with onions, chimichurri, and shredded cheese. Top with cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
